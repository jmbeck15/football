Football
========

This is an example project for a StackOverflow question.

The expected output of this program is set of four lines in the console:

    [Football::Engine] Created.
    [Stadium::Stadium] The game engine is set.
    [Football::Engine] The command was executed.
    [Stadium::Stadium] Told the game Engine to execute a command.

Compilation
-----------

### Windows

* Qt Creator 3.0.0
* MSVC 2012
* Qt 5.2.0.

The program compiles and runs just fine.

### Linux

* Qt Creator 3.0.0
* gcc 4.8.1
* Qt 5.2.0.

The program spews tons of vtable errors.
